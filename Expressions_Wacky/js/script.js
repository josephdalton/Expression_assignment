// Cherrell Stroud 9/12/13 Wacky Expression

//My wacky expression is how many hours do I spend on the computer a year?

//Given 

var cpu = 10; // the amount of time spent on the computer per day.
var week = 7; // days in a week.
var month = 12; // days in a year.


cpu *= 7 * 12 // multipled each number to get the amount of hours spent on the computer a year. 

console.log(cpu) // the answer to the equation is written here.
